# Aim Trainer
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
To fit the theme of "one button" the player is only able to do one action: shoot. The goal is to perform every single action in the game by shooting.

## Game Play
### Objective:
The player trains their aim on the different difficulty settings with the goal of being able to hit all the targets every time on the highest difficulty.
### Game-play instructions:
Left-click (or other form of mouse 1) allows the player to shoot the gun. Interactable items aligned in the crosshair at the center of the screen are triggered when the player shoots. The player is able to first shoot different settings buttons to select thier settings and then the start button. After the start button is pressed, targets then spawn in the range, but disappear over time. Shooting targets adds to the score and the score is displayed at the end of the round. If a score is higher than the best score, then the best score is updated.

## What did you 
I primarily struggled with some logical errors and animations. The logic was due to the sheer number of interactions that can happen when the gun is fired. The number of settings also caused some confusion along the way.

## Implementation
### 
- Firing range created using probuilder
- Fireable gun (downloaded model, custom animation, downloaded sound effect)
- Moving targets
- Multiple difficulty settings
### Assets, or resources used
- Textures from https://freepbr.com/shop/
- Gun model from http://kenney.nl
- Gunshot sound effect from https://freesound.org/people/Xenonn/sounds/128296/
- Round complete and target spawned sound effects from https://sfbgames.itch.io/chiptone

## Special Focus
The primary focus was mechanics. I wanted to focus on making a balanced game, with appropriate models, textures, sound effects, and functionality. Having taken G320 already, I wanted to challenge myself a bit more on the programming side of the assignment and keep the art and sound to an effective amount without taking too much emphasis away from the game's core purpose of functionality.

## References
None. I would occasionally use google for strict unity definitions and functionalities, but I wanted to create an aim trainer in my own image and challenge myself on the programming side by not following any blueprint.

## Future Development
- Background music
- Accuracy statisitcs
- Sound only mode (targets spawn around player with sound effect but are invisible)
